# OpenVim
Interactive tutorial for Vim.

## What is OpenVim?

OpenVim is a web-based project to let people quickly have a taste what kind of an editor Vim is.
Vim is considered to be very useful but can feel devastatingly opaque at first. Hopefully this tutorial makes people feel more comfortable to give it a chance.

OpenVim is based on a custom engine that interprets vim commands. 
Fun fact: the engine operates directly on the dom but can be easily refactored to a model that is not view-dependent.

## How to help?

If you want to help with actual code, look at the existing GitHub issues. Especially keybindings are hard for me to get right in different environments.

See [Trello board](https://trello.com/board/openvim/4e71135e9dbc8100001b9c5c) for development tasks.
